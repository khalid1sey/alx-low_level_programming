pointer is a variable which contain the adress.
every time you declare a variable the computer reserves a memory for the variable.
the size is determined by bytes 1 bytes = 8 bits().its size will be affected by the computer using and the type of the variable.
char - 19(8b)
int - 4 (32b)
float - 4 (32b)
pointer - 8 (64b)
to determine sizeof a variable in c there is a operator (sizeof()) which returns the size of given variable in byte



write a function that calculates the length of given string
str = "My first strlen!";

temp = *(str + i);
