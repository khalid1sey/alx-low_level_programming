    Your code will be compiled this way:

<code>$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 *.c -o monty</code>

    Any output must be printed on stdout
    Any error message must be printed on stderr
        Here is a link to a GitHub repository that could help you making sure your errors are printed on stderr


# Opcode(operation code)
* opcode is fundemental concept in computer archtechure and programming. it refers to a numeric code that represents a specfic operation or instruction that a computer's cpu can execute.

* An opcode is part of the machine language instruction format, which is the lowest level of programming language understood by a computer. Each opcode corresponds to a particular operation, such as arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, etc.), logical operations (AND, OR, NOT), data movement (load, store), branching (jump, conditional jump), and more.

* In a typical computer architecture, an instruction consists of an opcode followed by operands, which are the data or addresses on which the operation acts. The CPU fetches an instruction from memory, interprets the opcode, and performs the specified operation using the provided operands.
